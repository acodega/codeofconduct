# Administrative Team Guidelines

The MacAdmins Slack Administrative Team are here to ensure that the community runs within the spirit and guidelines of the [Code Of Conduct (CoC)](https://github.com/macadminsdotorg/codeofconduct), and to manage the technical aspects of keeping the MacAdmins slack running. We are also fellow Mac Admins, so when it comes to products, how to do things, why to do things etc - please take our input only as fellow Mac Admins and not as statements or endorsements from the Administrative Team.

On all subjects, other than running of the MacAdmins Slack and the [CoC](https://github.com/macadminsdotorg/codeofconduct), the Administrative Teamâ€™s opinions are their own and do not necessarily reflect those of the rest of MacAdmins Slack Administrative Team or the MacAdmin community.
