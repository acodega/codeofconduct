Welcome to the MacAdmins Slack.

This community is a complement to the Freenode IRC channels, the various MDM and package management user forums, the Facebook groups, and the mailing lists and seeks to provide a safe, friendly community for Mac administrators, enthusiasts, and developers to interact with one another.

All are welcome to participate within the Slack instance as long as the tenants of this Code of Conduct are adhered to.

Abide by Wheaton’s Law: don’t be a dick.
Everyone is welcome to participate, and no judgement will be made on members of the greater Mac community who are not a part of the community.
Be welcoming of everyone: discrimination based on gender identity, race, religion, nationality, political beliefs, sexual preference, preferred technological ecosystem, and concerns that have not been included in this list will be addressed with progressive discipline based on the severity of the infraction as determined by the administrative team.
Harassment, hate speech, bullying, sea-lioning, and gas-lighting are prohibited activities and are grounds for suspension from the community when there is clear documentation in public channels. If you experience any of these behaviors in direct messages please immediately contact the administrative team.
Your direct messages are only viewable by yourself and the other involved party and no one else. That being said, this is a community for professional communication and should be treated accordingly, regardless of the number of animated GIFs.
If you have concerns regarding this Slack instance please feel free to contact the administrative team and we will work to understand and address them respectfully and with an appropriate level of privacy to the given situation.

We hope that you find the community to be enriching to your personal and professional lives, and above all else a place of camaraderie where our collective knowledge and differences are celebrated in a positive, welcoming environment.

Thank you for following this code of conduct. We reserve the right to amend or change the code of conduct at any time and encourage you to periodically review these guidelines to ensure a safe environment for all.
